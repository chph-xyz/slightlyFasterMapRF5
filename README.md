(this is absolutely scuffed, use at your own risk)

this mod is used with MelonLoader (v0.6.6)

what does this mod do?
- slightly speed up map navigations (snappy inputs)
- the warp list fade effect lasts 0.15 seconds. this mod reduces it to 0 seconds.
- while navigating the warp menu, there is a 0.5s delay before hitting confirm. this mod reduces it to 0 seconds.

instruction:
- place rf_logging.dll into: steamapps\common\Rune Factory 5\Mods
- (or wherever your Rune Factory 5 Mods folder is)
